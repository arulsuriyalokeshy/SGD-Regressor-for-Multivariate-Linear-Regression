1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
Step 1: Start the program

Step 2: Data Preparation 

Step 3: Hypothesis Definition 

Step 4: Cost Function 

Step 5: Parameter Update Rule 

Step 6: Iterative Training 

Step 7: Model Evaluation 

Step 8: End the program


## Program:
